# 3âƒ£ Buying server

The drainer script must be installed on a clean server running the Ubuntu 20.04 operating system without pre-installed software (Apache, Cpanel, etc.)

For these purposes I use [https://zomro.com](https://zomro.com) You need to register an account on this platform and fund your account

After registration and replenishment of the balance, go to the page https://cp.zomro.com/services/vps/vps\_order

* Choose "**ADVANCED SSD**"

* The correct settings look like this. Then buy a server

*   After that, on the page [https://cp.zomro.com/services/vps](https://cp.zomro.com/services/vps) you will have your purchased server.

    Click on the three dots and select instruction

* A new window will appear and then

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (18).png>)

You need to save this data. This ip address will run the drainer script in the future
