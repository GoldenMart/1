# 3âƒ£ Buying server

The drainer script must be installed on a clean server running the Ubuntu 20.04 operating system without pre-installed software (Apache, Cpanel, etc.)

For these purposes I use [https://ultahost.com](https://ultahost.com/vps-hosting) You need to register an account on this platform and fund your account

After registration and replenishment of the balance, go to the page [https://bill.ultahost.com/store/linux-vps-hosting](https://bill.ultahost.com/store/linux-vps-hosting)

* Choose "**VPS Business**"

After purchasing the server, you need to save the server IP address, username and password. This information is needed for further configuration.

You need to save this data. This ip address will run the drainer script in the future
