# ðŸ¤© Buying hosting

Hosting is needed in order to install your landing pages on it and attach domains to it

For these purposes I use [https://zomro.com](https://zomro.com) You need to register an account on this platform and fund your account.

After registration and replenishment of the balance, go to the page [https://cp.zomro.com/services/vhost/vhost\_order](https://cp.zomro.com/services/vhost/vhost\_order) and click "order"

I choose "FAVOURABLE". This hosting is suitable for hosting a maximum of 10 sites with your landing pages.

When the status changes to "Active" then click on the three dots and select "Instructions"

In the window that opens, you need to write down the IP address of the hosting. In my case it is "45.147.197.40"
