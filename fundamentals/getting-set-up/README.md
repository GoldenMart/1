# ðŸ›  Getting set up

_**Terms:**_

**Server with a drainer** - is software that performs the function of imperceptibly writing off assets from the victim's wallet. The Drainer is installed on a separate server.

**Landing page** - is a web hosting site. Landing requires hosting and a domain.

**Technical domain** - is a domain attached to a Cloudflare account and with A configured to write to the IP address of the server where the drainer is installed. This domain will not be used to install landing on it. This domain is needed only in order to "Connect landing to a dreader."

**Landing page domain** - is any registered domain that will be used to attach a landing to it.\
Connecting a landing to a dreader means setting up a landing bundle with a "Server with a Dreader." For one drainer, there can be a lot of landings.
