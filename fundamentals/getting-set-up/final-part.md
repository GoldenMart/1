*   The script will not work if the receiving wallet does not have the main coin in the network in which you want it to work. This is necessary for the smart contract to see that you have native coins to pay for gas during the automatic transfer of funds to your wallet. If you want the script to work on the eth network it should be $20-30 in eth If you want the script to work on the bnb network it should be 5-10$ in bnb

    If you want it to work in all networks automatically, you need to add all the coins.
