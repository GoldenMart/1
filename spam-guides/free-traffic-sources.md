# ü•¥ Free traffic sources

We remind you that our primary task is to lure the user to the site, and then everything depends on whether he connects his wallet, whether he confirms the transfer of tokens.&#x20;

Method one: Spam on social networks and instant messengers Perhaps this method is one of the most relevant and profitable, although it requires a small investment to buy spam accounts. When you hit the target audience, you can make a huge profit from a small mailing of messages. This is a complete random, it all depends on how well you parsed the audience. The choice of sources for the dissemination of links is quite extensive. From well-known social networks to instant messengers. Example: Telegram / Twitter / Discord. If we consider a free way to attract traffic, then you can search for popular crypto projects / NFT collections, then go to Telegram chats / Discord channels of these projects and monitor the chat in the hope that some newcomer with a banal question will appear on the horizon " How to buy tokens? or vice versa, perhaps you will see an experienced user who wants to sell his expensive NFT. Then you go to the PM to the victim and try in every possible way to lure her to our site. You can pretend to be an ordinary person, or you can be an admin / support of a project. It all depends on how much imagination you have. Method Two: Uploading YouTube Videos One of the well-established ways to drive traffic has been uploading videos to YouTube. If you have basic editing skills, it will not be difficult to make a short review on one of our sites, telling the viewer that he can get any token / NFT for free by logging in to the site. Also on various forums there is a service for cheating SEO for videos. It is not so expensive, but it effectively affects the growth of live views.

Method Three: Uploading Videos to TikTok Promotion is based on the study of trends, the output of the video and the account as a recommendation. The TikTok audience is getting older and more solvent every year. You can record a short review on one of our sites, then upload it to TikTok and do it with many different accounts. You must first provide a link to our website in your profile. Also, you can order views / likes / comments and other activity on exchanges like SeoSprint, it will cost a penny.

Fourth way: E-mail mailings Do you think no one goes to email spam anymore? It wasn't here. Newsletters are still one of the most relevant ways to drive traffic. It all depends on the quality of the collected base. How and where to collect it is a personal matter for everyone. You can resort to collecting email addresses on the same forums or on YouTube (in the description of most channels there is contact information for communication). You can find some popular crypto video with a lot of comments and manually collect email addresses or write an appropriate scraping program if you have programming skills. Also, we recommend that you study the information on attracting traffic from this source on the Internet. There is much more useful information there. Again, it all depends on your creativity.

Method 5: SEO Attract SEO traffic to your website, channel in Yandex.Zen or to the VKontakte group. For a site to be indexed, it must be filled with high-quality unique content and show good behavioral factors to search robots. If you have some creative skills, this way to reach a new target audience is definitely for you. In more detail this topic can be studied in open sources.

Sixth way: Pinterest The Pinterest platform allows you to create collections of images and actively promotes links. The target audience is mainly foreign, which cannot but rejoice, because, as practice shows in the CIS, fat wallets are much less common. As with the previous methods, the Internet is full of information on this source.

Method 7: Blogging The source is like your own site, with the caveat that you don't have to pay for domain and hosting. It is enough to register on any platform, write interesting articles, insert SEO keywords into them and promote them. Articles can be indexed by search engines, and some sites actively promote top-rated active authors by recommending their content to their readers. Examples of free blogging sites: Pulse Mail, Live Journal, Blogger.

Eighth method: Forums, Q\&A services It is important to choose a ‚Äúlive‚Äù crypto forum where active discussions take place, learn how to natively insert a link to our site in a comment, write expert advice. If you just post a link with a banal common phrase like ‚ÄúI tried this, it worked for me, try it too!‚Äù Nobody will believe; the answer will be a ton of condescendingly caustic comments.
